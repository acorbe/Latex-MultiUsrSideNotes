MultiUsrSideNotes
=================

A LaTex package allowing several users to put side notes in a paper, e.g. for reviewing purpose. A login-like procedure allows different author notes to be distinguished by tags and colors.

USAGE: 
----------------
Login phase - to be put in the header of the document before `\begin{document}`

```latex
\SnNewUserID[a]{b}{c}
%a -> UserDistinguishing char, e.g. Â°, default = *
%b -> UserInitial e.g. AC
%c -> NameOfTheCommandToMakeANewNote e.g. ACNote
```

Example:
```latex
\SnNewUserID[*]{AC}{ACNote}
%generates the LaTex command `\ACNote{<myNote>}`. 
%When called it generates a side notes marked by 
%`*` owing to the user whose initials are `AC`.
```

Up to six users are supported so far. The colors distinguishing their notes, which are assinged according to login order, are 
```latex
% (from MultiUsrSideNotes.sty)
\SnAddColor{yellow}
\SnAddColor{blue}
\SnAddColor{green}
\SnAddColor{gray}
\SnAddColor{red}
\SnAddColor{pink}
```
.
